What is promotional SMS?

Promotional SMS is a way of sending short message service (SMS) messages to your business’s audience. This is a great way to communicate and engage with your audience to inform them of important deals and promotions and encourage them to make purchases. Alongside other channels, promotional texting can play an important role in improving your business’s sales and retention.

An SMS platform lets brands send many promotional SMS messages at once to reach a larger audience. These messages need to be fairly short in order to be effective. Not only will longer messages make your texts less engaging, but they will be more expensive to send.
